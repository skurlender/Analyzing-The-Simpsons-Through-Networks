# Analyzing-The-Simpsons-Through-Networks

The Simpsons is known for its inordinate number of supporting characters, so I used R-Studio to see how R clusters the characters compared to my own clustering, to see how 
average IMDB rating affects this clustering, and to see if there’s a connection between certain characters and the rating of the average IMDB rating of their episodes

I looked at most characters, but left out ones who appeared in under 3 episodes throughout seasons 3-8. Even after not including these characters and the Simpsons family 
themselves, I looked at 74 (!) characters. Also, I just enjoy the show and figured that with its status and cultural importance, it’d be fascinating to look at.
